                    Hey there! So as you may know, leadership is totally a volunteer force but we’ve been impressed
                    with your activity with the community and was wondering if that was something you may be
                    interested in at some point? It is <strong>totally</strong> acceptable to say no as it does
                    require a bit more activity! Thank you for your dedication to Phoenix!

                    Hey there [username]! So as you may know, here at Phoenix we do have activity requirements and
                    it unfortunately appears you may not be reaching them right now. We completely understand that
                    stuff happens. If your situation changes and you can be around more than great! If not then we
                    will unfortunately have to remove your roles, but you are more than welcome to reapply when you
                    are able to dedicate more time!
